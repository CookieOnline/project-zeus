# Project Zeus

The aim of this project, is racing a Renault Zoe in a 24 hour endurance race. The purpose of this repository is to store plans, schematics, software, job list etc., to help others. 

Motorsport is one the best testing grounds for any technology, especially automotive. If a car can be thrashed within an inch of it's life for 24 hours and still run, chances are it's going to be fine for school runs and shopping trips.

Yes, EV tech is still fraught with problems. But motorsport used to be about solving hard technical challenges, not waiting for an off the shelf solution and playing it safe! Battery tech is coming on fast, safety and sustainability are improving. Also, there are alternatives to li-ion which are very much in the early stages. Which is where we can help develop that technology on the race track.
